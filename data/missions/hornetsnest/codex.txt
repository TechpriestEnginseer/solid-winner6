Visit Callisto Ibrahim on Agresus in the Arcadia system to convert up to 4,000 ores and 1,000 transplutonic ores into metal and transplutonics at a 1:1 ratio. She doesn't care how you acquire them. She will convert more per interaction when you turn in her precious ISS Hamatsu. This is one of the best ways to farm independent reputation.
